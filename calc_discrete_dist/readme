calculate_discrete_distributions

Program to calculate "binned" or discrete distributions
of 5D grain boundary crytsallography data.

The program will also project the 5D data to 
1 (disorientation angle), 2 (GB plane), or 3 (axis-angle)
distributions.

When a one dimensional disorientation distribution is produced, 
it can be graphed directly by any graphing application that 
accepts text files.  However, to visualize the multidiminaional 
outputs, you need to use the program: graph_discrete_distributions.

PROGRAM FOR COMPUTING DISCRETIZED GRAIN BOUNDARY 
DISTRIBUTIONS. IT CAN COMPUTE 1D DISORIENTATION
DISTRIBUTIONS, 2D GRAIN BOUNDARY PLANE DISTRIBUTIONS
(GBPDs), AND 5D GRAIN BOUNDARY CHARACTER
DISTRIBUTIONS (GBCDs).  3D TRIANGLE DATA IS SIMPLY
DISCRETIZED INTO BINS.  DATA CONSISTING OF GRAIN
BOUNDARY TRACES OBSERVED ON A SECTION PLANE ARE
INTERPRETED STEREOLOGICALLY ACCORDING TO 
SAYLOR ET AL., MET TRANS. 35A (2004) 1981. LINE
SEGMENT DATA CAN ALSO BE BINNED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION
THAT THE MICROSTRUCTURE IS COLUMNAR

This program combines all prior programs for computing discrete
distributions.  Grain boundary line segment (trace) data is
interpreted stereologically or under the columnar assumption.
Grain boundary triangle data, from 3D studies, is interpreted
as 3D data.  This version uses the full domain of misorientations
for non-cubic structures and improves variable definitions.
