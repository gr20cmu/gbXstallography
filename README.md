# gbXstallography
programs used to compute and plot distributions of grain boundary properties

Each folder contains a separate tool for manipulating, filtering, transforming, 
computing, or graphing grain boundary distributions.  There is a readme file
in each folder explaining what the program does and an example or examples 
illustrating the input and output of the program.

Additional information, example data and output, and more can be found at:
