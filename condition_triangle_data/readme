Dream.3D makes it possible to export triangles files. 
These are text files that specify all of the boundaries
as a set of triangles.  These files can be used to compute
discrete or continuous distributions.  On each line of the file, 
the Euler angles on either side of the triangle are specified,
the normal to the triangle in the lab reference frame is specified,
and the area is listed.  
Some of the triangle have Euler angles of 0, 0, 0, 
because one of the orientations is unknown.  These
create problems later.  This program removes them.

PROGRAM TO READ TRIANGLE DATA, REMOVE LINES 
WHERE EULER ANGLES WITH ZERO VALUES ARE FOUND 

This version just removes lines with zero Euler angles
The parts used for filtering based on thresholds are
commented out.
