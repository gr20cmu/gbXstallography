In this simple example, I condition the file: SmallIn100_TriangleFile.ph,
written by Dream.3D, by removing all lines where the Euler angles 
are equal to zero, and writing it to: SmallIn100_TriangleFile_cnd.txt
Unfortunately, these files are too large to post to GitHub.  You 
should be able to get zipped versions of these files at:

Here is the I/O on the consol.

I am going to look for data in the file labeled: SmallIn100_TriangleFile.ph                                                                          
There are  2601863 lines in the data file.
           5  lines in the header
 zero Eulers:      465296
 final number of lines =     2136562
