Some SrTiO3 data from the Grain_Boundary_Data_Archive

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The input parameters for condition_segs are above this line.
All text below the line is for instructions/notes and is not used by the code.

- The first line is the base name of the files that contain the line segments in the TSL output format.  This file name has to have a special format, as in:
segments_NNN.txt, where 'segments' is the base name.

- If any individual file has more the 3,000,000 lines, the dimension of the s matrix in common must be increased to greater than or equal to the number.  After you change this, and the threshold in the check, you must recompile with "make".

- The second line is a name you pick where the output will be written.  This is the entire file name, such as 'all_segments.txt'

- The third line is the number of the first file in the sequence, which must must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 999.  For example, if this is 0, then the first file name is "segments_000.txt"

- The fourth line is the number of the last file in the sequence, with the same restrictions as the first line.  For example, if this is file 99, then the last file name is "segments_099.txt"  If you are conditioning a single file this number must equal the number on line three.

- The fifth line is the number of columns in the input file.  This number must be 10, 12, 14, or 21.

- The sixth line is the number of columns in the output file.  The value must be 10 or 12.

- The seventh line is a flag to turn off/on (0/1) file concatenation.  If 1, all files written to one file.  If 0, each file is written to a new file.

- The eighth line is a comment that will be written into the header
