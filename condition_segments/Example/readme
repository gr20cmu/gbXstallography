As an example of using condition segments, we'll consider the data in five text files SrTiO3_segs_00N.txt, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 5.  
These data are in the 14 column format, and we want to write then in the 10 column format, concatenated into a single file.  
For this, we set the parameters in input.txt to:

SrTiO3_segs
all_SrTiO3_segs.txt
2
6
14
10
1
Some SrTiO3 data from the Grain_Boundary_Data_Archive

See details in input.txt for an explanation of the parameters.

We begin by compiling it using the makefile:

(base) gr20MacMin-2:condition_segments gr20$ make
gfortran -O3 -c -ffixed-line-length-none main.f 
gfortran  main.o  -o condition_segs

Then running the executable:

(base) gr20MacMin-2:condition_segments gr20$ condition_segs
==============================================
 PROGRAM PREPARES GRAIN BOUNDARY SEGMENT FILES
 FOR ANALYSIS BY WRITING THEM IN A 10 OR 12  
 COLUMN FORMAT.  MULTIPLE FILES CAN BE 
 CONCATENATED INTO A SINGLE FILE.

==============================================
There are    945 lines in file  2.
           1  lines in the header
There are    986 lines in file  3.
           1  lines in the header
There are    968 lines in file  4.
           1  lines in the header
There are    950 lines in file  5.
           1  lines in the header
There are    936 lines in file  6.
           1  lines in the header
(base) gr20MacMin-2:condition_segments gr20$ 

This will produced the file: all_SrTiO3_segs.txt
That will include all segments from the five input files.

In some cases, you might not want to put them in a single file.  For example, if they are part a of 3D stack, then you might 
want to keep them in separate file to seek triple lines.  In this case, you change the parameters in the input file to read:

SrTiO3_segs
all_SrTiO3_segs.txt
2
6
14
10
0
Some SrTiO3 data from the Grain_Boundary_Data_Archive

The change in the seventh line from 1 to 0 turns off the concatenation. 

When we run it this time, five ten column files with the names:
SrTiO3_segs_cnd_00N.txt, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 5, are created.  These have the same information as the original files, but are in the 10 column format.

If you need to check that the information is transferred properly, you can edit the files to only contain a small number of lines.  
Then, you can easily check to make sure the correct numbers appear in the right places.
